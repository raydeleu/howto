= Creating video titles with Inkscape

== Why create titles in Inkscape
If you are creating videos, vlogs or short films you will do this often in a video editor. Not all video editors have a good system to create titles. Furthermore you are often somewhat limited in the type of titles. For example, if you use iMovie or Final Cut Pro, you really have to improvise a lot if you have specific whishes how your titles, credits or annotations should look. Some of these packages offer (paid) add-on's, but if you use freeware of open source software such as Blender or ShotCut you are on your own. 

A very simple way to create titles is to create images with a transparant background that you can superimpose on top of your videos. An open source package that is suited for this task is Inkscape. This Howto describes the steps to follow when creating video titles.
